## Challenge: goals, context and expectations

## The Challenge: Investigating a question using an organization's database

* Need both familiarity with the data and a focus question
  + An iterative process where 
    + the data resource can shape your understanding of the question
    + the question you need to answer will frame how you see the data resource
  + You need to go back and forth between the two, asking 
    + do I understand the question?
    + do I understand the data?

* How well do you understand the data resource (in the DBMS)?
  + Use all available documentation and understand its limits
  + Use your own tools and skills to examine the data resource
  + What is *missing* from the database: (columns, records, cells)
  + Why is the data missing?
  
* How well do you understand the question you seek to answer?
  + How general or specific is your question?
  + How aligned is it with the purpose for which the database was designed and is being operated?
  + How different are your assumptions and concerns from those of the people who enter and use the data on a day to day basis?


## Ask yourself, what are you aiming for?  

* Differences between production and data warehouse environments.
* Learning to keep your DBAs happy:
  + You are your own DBA in this simulation, so you can wreak havoc and learn from it, but you can learn to be DBA-friendly here.
  + In the end it's the subject-matter experts that understand your data, but you have to work with your DBAs first.

### Problems that are addressed

* Database exploration 
* Wisdom from Sophie

### Learning Objectives

After working through the code in this book, you can expect to be able to:

* R, SQL and PostgreSQL
  * Run queries against PostgreSQL in an environment that simulates what is found in a corporate setting.
  * Understand techniques and some of the trade-offs between:
      * queries aimed at exploration or informal investigation using [dplyr](https://cran.r-project.org/package=dplyr)    [@Wickham2018]; and 
      * queries that should be written in SQL, because performance is important due to the size of the database or the frequency  with which a query is to be run.
  * Understand the equivalence between `dplyr` and SQL queries, and how R translates one into the other.
  * Gain familiarity with techniques that help you explore a database and verify its documentation.
  * Gain familiarity with the standard metadata that a SQL database contains to describe its own contents.
  * Understand some advanced SQL techniques.
  * Gain some understanding of techniques for assessing query structure and performance.
* Docker related
  * Set up a PostgreSQL database in a Docker environment. 
  * Gain familiarity with the various ways of interacting with the Docker and PostgreSQL environments
  * Understand enough about Docker to swap databases, e.g. [Sports DB](http://www.sportsdb.org/sd/samples) for the [DVD rental database](http://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-sample-database/) used in this tutorial. Or swap the database management system (DBMS), e.g. [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) for [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/).

* [RPostgres](https://cran.r-project.org/package=RPostgres)
* [skimr](https://cran.r-project.org/package=skimr)
* [sqlpetr](https://github.com/smithjd/sqlpetr) (installs with: `remotes::install_github("smithjd/sqlpetr", force = TRUE, quiet = TRUE, build = TRUE, build_opts = "")`)

* [DiagrammeR](https://cran.r-project.org/package=DiagrammeR)

## Imagining a DVD rental business

Years ago, people rented videos on DVD disks and video stores were a big business.  To understand the data base that we use in this book, try to imagine managing a video rental store [like Movie Madness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movie_Madness_Video) in Portland, Oregon.
```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("screenshots/movie-madness-sample.png")
```
*What data would be needed and what questions would you have to answer about the business?*

This tutorial uses [the PostgreSQL version of "dvd rental" database](http://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-sample-database/) which represents the transaction database for running a movie (e.g., dvd) rental business.  The database can be  [downloaded here](http://www.postgresqltutorial.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/dvdrental.zip).  Here's a glimpse of it's structure, which we explore using several different methods:

A data analyst uses the database abstraction and the practical business questions to make better decisions and solve problems.

## Use cases 

Imagine that you have one of following several roles at our fictional company **DVDs R Us** and you have a following need to be met:

* As a data scientist, I want to know the distribution of number of rentals per month per customer, so that the Marketing department can create incentives for customers in 3 segments: Frequent Renters, Average Renters, Infrequent Renters.
* As the Director of Sales, I want to see the total number of rentals per month for the past 6 months and I want to know how fast our customer base is growing/shrinking per month for the past 6 months.
* As the Director of Marketing, I want to know which categories of DVDs are the least popular, so that I can create a campaign to draw attention to rarely used inventory.
* As a shipping clerk, I want to add rental information when I fulfill a shipment order.
* As the Director of Analytics, I want to test as much of the production R code in my shop as possible against a new release of the DBMS that the IT department is implementing next month.
* etc.
