# SQL Joins Exercises {#chapter_sql-joins-exercises}

> This chapter contains questions one may be curious about or asked about the DVD Rental business.  
> The goal of the exercises is extracting useful or questionable insights from one or more tables.   Each exercise has has some or all of the following parts.
>
>  1.  The question.
>  2.  The tables used to answer the question.
>  3.  A hidden SQL code block showing the desired output. Click the code button to see the SQL code.   
>  4.  A table of derived values or renamed columns shown in the SQL block to facilitate replicating the desired dplyr solution.  Abbreviated column names are used to squeeze in more columns into the answer to reduce scrolling across the screen.
>  5.  A replication section where you recreate the desired output using dplyr syntax.  Most columns come directly out of the tables.  Each replication code block has three commented function calls 
>    *  sp_tbl_descr('store')        --describes a table, store
>    *  sp_tbl_pk_fk('table_name')   --shows a table's primary and foreign keys
>    *  sp_print_df(table_rows_sql)  --shows table row counts.
>    
> 6. To keep the exercises concentrated on the joins, all derived dates drop their timestamp.
>    *  SQL syntax:   date_column::DATE
>    *  Dplyr syntax: as.date(date_column)

```{r setup, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# These packages are called in almost every chapter of the book:
library(tidyverse)
library(DBI)
library(RPostgres)
library(glue)
library(here)
require(knitr)
library(dbplyr)
library(sqlpetr)
```

##  Exercise Instructions

1.  Manually execute all the code blocks up-to the "SQL Union Exercise."  
2.  Most of the exercises can be performed in any order.  
*  There are function exercises that create a function followed by another code block to call the function in the previous exercise.
3.  Use the Show Document Outline, CTL-Shift-O, to navigate to the different exercises.


```{r codeblock options,echo=FALSE}
ECHO_CODE_BLOCK = TRUE
HEAD_N = 10  #set to 0 for all rows or head(x,n=HEAD_N)
INCLUDE_OUTPUT  = TRUE
```

Verify Docker is up and running:

```{r}
sp_check_that_docker_is_up()
```

Verify pet DB is available, it may be stopped.

```{r}
sp_show_all_docker_containers()
```

Start up the `docker-pet` container

```{r}
sp_docker_start("sql-pet")
```

Now connect to the database with R

```{r}

# need to wait for Docker & Postgres to come up before connecting.

con <- sp_get_postgres_connection(
  user = Sys.getenv("DEFAULT_POSTGRES_USER_NAME"),
  password = Sys.getenv("DEFAULT_POSTGRES_PASSWORD"),
  dbname = "dvdrental",
  seconds_to_test = 30, connection_tab = TRUE
)
```

## Dplyr tables

All the tables defined in the DVD Rental System will fit into memory which is rarely the case when working with a database.  Instead of loading all the DVD Rental System tables into memory via a DBI::dbReadTable, each table is loaded into an R object named TableName_table, via a dplyr::tbl call.

*  actor_table <- dplyr::tbl(con,"actor")

```{r Declare Dplyr Tables}
source(here::here('book-src','dvdrental-table-declarations.R'),echo=FALSE)
```

The following code block deletes and inserts records into the different tables used in the exercises in this chpater.  The techniques used in this code block are discussed in detail in the appendix, ??add link here.??  

```{r collapse=TRUE}
source(file=here('book-src/sql_pet_data.R'),echo=FALSE)
```

## Overview Exercise

When joining many tables, it is helpful to have the number of rows from each table as an initial sanity check that the joins are returning a reasonable number of rows.

### 1.  How many rows are in each table?

```{r, code_folding='unhide',echo=ECHO_CODE_BLOCK}
table_rows_sql <- dbGetQuery(
  con,
  "select *
                 from (      select 'actor' tbl_name,count(*) from actor 
                       union select 'category' tbl_name,count(*) from category
                       union select 'film' tbl_name,count(*) from film
                       union select 'film_actor' tbl_name,count(*) from film_actor
                       union select 'film_category' tbl_name,count(*) from film_category
                       union select 'language' tbl_name,count(*) from language
                       union select 'inventory' tbl_name,count(*) from inventory
                       union select 'rental' tbl_name,count(*) from rental
                       union select 'payment' tbl_name,count(*) from payment
                       union select 'staff' tbl_name,count(*) from staff
                       union select 'customer' tbl_name,count(*) from customer
                       union select 'address' tbl_name,count(*) from address
                       union select 'city' tbl_name,count(*) from city
                       union select 'country' tbl_name,count(*) from country
                       union select 'store' tbl_name,count(*) from store
                       ) counts
                  order by tbl_name
                 ;
                "
)
sp_print_df(table_rows_sql)
```

#### Replicate the output above using dplyr syntax.

```{r dplyr union, include=INCLUDE_OUTPUT,echo=ECHO_CODE_BLOCK}
# sp_tbl_descr('table_name')
# sp_tbl_pk_fk('table_name')
# sp_print_df(table_rows_sql)

table_rows_dplyr <- 
  as.data.frame(actor_table %>% mutate(name = "actor") %>% group_by(name) %>% 
                  summarize(rows = n())) %>% 
  union(as.data.frame(address_table %>% mutate(name = "address") %>% group_by(name) %>% 
                        summarize(rows = n()))) %>% 
  arrange(name)

sp_print_df(table_rows_dplyr)
```

## Exercises

### 1. Where is the DVD Rental Business located?

To answer this question we look at the `store`, `address`, `city`, and `country` tables to answer this question.

```{r, code_folding='unhide'}
store_locations_sql <- dbGetQuery(con,
"select s.store_id
       ,a.address
       ,c.city
       ,a.district
       ,a.postal_code
       ,c2.country
       ,s.last_update
   from store s 
         join address a on s.address_id = a.address_id
         join city c on a.city_id = c.city_id
         join country c2 on c.country_id = c2.country_id
")
sp_print_df(store_locations_sql)
```

`r sp_color_markdown_text("Our DVD Rental business is international and operates in three countries, Canada, Austraila, and the United States.  Each country has one store.","blue")` 

#### Replicate the output above using dplyr syntax.

```{r, include=INCLUDE_OUTPUT}
# sp_tbl_descr('store')
# sp_tbl_pk_fk('table_name')
# sp_print_df(table_rows_sql)

store_locations_dplyr <- as.data.frame("code me")

sp_print_df(store_locations_dplyr)
```

### 2. List Each Store and the Staff Contact Information?

To answer this question we look at the `store`, `staff`, `address`, `city`, and `country` tables.

```{r, code_folding='unhide'}
store_employees_sql <- dbGetQuery(con,
"select st.store_id
       ,s.first_name
       ,s.last_name
       ,s.email
       ,a.phone
       ,a.address
       ,c.city
       ,a.district
       ,a.postal_code
       ,c2.country
   from store st left join staff s on st.manager_staff_id = s.staff_id 
         left join address a on s.address_id = a.address_id
         left join city c on a.city_id = c.city_id
         left join country c2 on c.country_id = c2.country_id
")
sp_print_df(store_employees_sql)
```

`r sp_color_markdown_text("Our DVD Rental business is international and operates in three countries, Canada, Austraila, and the United States.  Each country has one store.  The stores in Canada and Austrailia have one employee each, Mike Hillyer and Jon Stephens respectively.  The store in the United States has no employees yet.","blue")`

#### Replicate the output above using dplyr syntax.

```{r include=INCLUDE_OUTPUT}
# sp_tbl_descr('store')
# sp_tbl_pk_fk('table_name')
# sp_print_df(table_rows_sql)

store_employees_dplyr <- as.data.frame("code me")

sp_print_df(store_employees_dplyr)

```


### 3. How Many Active, Inactive, and Total Customers Does the DVD Rental Business Have?

To answer this question we look at the `customer` table.  In a previous chapter we observed that there are two columns, `activebool` and `active`.  We consider `active = 1` as active.

```{r, code_folding='unhide'}
customer_cnt_sql <- dbGetQuery(con,
"SELECT sum(case when active = 1 then 1 else 0 end) active
       ,sum(case when active = 0 then 1 else 0 end) inactive
       ,count(*) total
   from customer
")

sp_print_df(customer_cnt_sql)
```

`r sp_color_markdown_text('
Our DVD Rental business is international and operates in three countries, Canada, Austraila, and the United States.  Each country has one store.  The stores in Canada and Austrailia have one employee each.  The store in the United States has no employees yet.  

The business has 604 international customers, 589 are active and 15 inactive.','blue')`


#### Replicate the output above using dplyr syntax.

```{r include=INCLUDE_OUTPUT}
# sp_tbl_descr('store')
# sp_tbl_pk_fk('table_name')
# sp_print_df(table_rows_sql)

customer_cnt_dplyr <- as.data.frame("code me")

sp_print_df(customer_cnt_dplyr)
```

### 4. How Many and What Percent of Customers Are From Each Country?

To answer this question we look at the `customer`, `address`, `city`, and `country` tables. 

```{r, code_folding='unhide'}
customers_sql <- dbGetQuery(con,
"select c.active,country.country,count(*) count
              ,round(100 * count(*) / sum(count(*)) over(),4) as pct
         from customer c
              join address a on c.address_id = a.address_id
              join city  on a.city_id = city.city_id
              join country on city.country_id = country.country_id
         group by c.active,country
order by count(*) desc
")
sp_print_df(customers_sql)
```

`r sp_color_markdown_text('
Based on the table above, the DVD Rental business has customers in 118 countries.  The DVD Rental business cannot have many walk in customers.  It may possibly use a mail order distribution model.

For an international company, how are the different currencies converted to a standard currency?  Looking at the ERD, there is no currency conversion rate.','blue')`

#### Replicate the output above using dplyr syntax.

```{r include=INCLUDE_OUTPUT}
# sp_tbl_descr('store')
# sp_tbl_pk_fk('table_name')
# sp_print_df(table_rows_sql)

customers_dplyr <- as.data.frame("code me")

sp_print_df(customers_dplyr)
```

### 5 What Countries Constitute the Top 25% of the Customer Base?

Using the previous code, add two new columns.  One column shows a running total and the second column shows a running percentage.  Order the data by count then by country.

To answer this question we look at the `customer`, `address`, `city`, and `country` tables again.

```{r, code_folding='unhide'}
country_sql <- dbGetQuery(con,
                            
"select active,country,count
       ,sum(count) over (order by count desc,country rows between unbounded preceding and current row) running_total
       , pct
       ,sum(pct) over (order by pct desc,country rows between unbounded preceding and current row) running_pct
  from (-- Start of inner SQL Block
        select c.active,country.country,count(*) count
              ,round(100 * count(*) / sum(count(*)) over(),4) as pct
         from customer c
              join address a on c.address_id = a.address_id
              join city  on a.city_id = city.city_id
              join country on city.country_id = country.country_id
         group by c.active,country
       ) ctry  -- End of inner SQL Block
 order by count desc,country
")
sp_print_df(country_sql)
```

`r sp_color_markdown_text('
The top 25% of the customer base are from India, China, the United States, and Japan.  The next six countries, the top 10, Mexico, Brazil, Russian Federation, Philipines, Indonesia, and Turkey round out the top 50% of the businesses customer base.','blue')`

#### Replicate the output above using dplyr syntax.

```{r include=INCLUDE_OUTPUT}
# sp_tbl_descr('store')
# sp_tbl_pk_fk('table_name')
# sp_print_df(table_rows_sql)

country_dplyr <- as.data.frame("code me")

sp_print_df(country_dplyr)
```

### 6. How many customers are in Australia and Canada?

To answer this question we use the results from the previous exercise.

```{r, code_folding='unhide'}
country_au_ca_sql <- country_sql %>% filter(country == 'Australia' | country == 'Canada')
sp_print_df(country_au_ca_sql)
```

`r sp_color_markdown_text("There are 10 customers in Austrailia and Canada where the brick and mortar stores are located.  The 20 customers are less than 2% of the world wide customer base.  ",'blue')`

#### Replicate the output above using dplyr syntax.

```{r include=INCLUDE_OUTPUT}
# sp_tbl_descr('store')
# sp_tbl_pk_fk('table_name')
# sp_print_df(table_rows_sql)

country_au_ca_dplyr <- as.data.frame("code me")

sp_print_df(country_au_ca_dplyr)
```

### 7. How Many Languages?

With an international customer base, how many languages does the DVD Rental business distribute DVD's in.

To answer this question we look at the `language` table.

```{r, code_folding='unhide'}
languages_sql <- dbGetQuery(con,
"
select * from language
")

sp_print_df(languages_sql)
```

`r sp_color_markdown_text("DVD's are distributed in six languages.","blue")`

#### Replicate the output above using dplyr syntax.

```{r include=INCLUDE_OUTPUT}
# sp_tbl_descr('store')
# sp_tbl_pk_fk('table_name')
# sp_print_df(table_rows_sql)

# languages_dplyr <- as.data.frame("code me")
# 
# sp_print_df(language_table)
```

### 8.  What is the distribution of DVD's by Language 

To answer this question we look at the `language` and `film` tables.

```{r, code_folding='unhide'}
language_distribution_sql <- dbGetQuery(con,
'
select l.language_id,name "language",count(f.film_id)
  from language l left join film f on l.language_id = f.language_id
group by l.language_id,name
order by l.language_id
')

sp_print_df(language_distribution_sql)
```

`r sp_color_markdown_text("This is a surprise.  For an international customer base, the entire stock of 1001 DVD's are in English only.",'blue')`

#### Replicate the output above using dplyr syntax.

```{r include=INCLUDE_OUTPUT}
# sp_tbl_descr('store')
# sp_tbl_pk_fk('table_name')
# sp_print_df(table_rows_sql)

language_distribution_dplyr <- as.data.frame("code me")

sp_print_df(language_distribution_dplyr)
```

### 9.  What are the number of rentals and rented amount by store, by month?

To answer this question we look at the `rental`, `inventory`, and `film` tables to answer this question. 

```{r, code_folding='unhide'}
store_rentals_by_mth_sql <- dbGetQuery(con,
"select *
       ,sum(rental_amt) over (order by yyyy_mm,store_id rows 
                              between unbounded preceding and current row) running_rental_amt
   from (select yyyy_mm,store_id,rentals,rental_amt
               ,sum(rentals) over(partition by yyyy_mm order by store_id) mo_rentals
               ,sum(rental_amt) over (partition by yyyy_mm order by store_id) mo_rental_amt
           from (select to_char(rental_date,'yyyy-mm') yyyy_mm
                       ,i.store_id,count(*) rentals, sum(f.rental_rate) rental_amt
                   from rental r join inventory i on r.inventory_id = i.inventory_id 
                        join film f on i.film_id = f.film_id
                 group by to_char(rental_date,'yyyy-mm'),i.store_id
                ) as details
        ) as mo_running
order by yyyy_mm,store_id
")
sp_print_df(store_rentals_by_mth_sql)
```


`r sp_color_markdown_text("The current entry, row 11, is our new rental row we added to show the different joins in a previous chapter.
",'blue')`

#### Replicate the output above using dplyr syntax.

```{r include=INCLUDE_OUTPUT}
# sp_tbl_descr('store')
# sp_tbl_pk_fk('table_name')
# sp_print_df(table_rows_sql)

store_rentals_by_mth_dplyr <- as.data.frame("code me")
    
sp_print_df(head(store_rentals_by_mth_dplyr, n=25))
```

### 10.  Rank Films Based on the Number of Times Rented and Associated Revenue

To answer this question we look at the `rental`, `inventory`, and `film` tables.

```{r, code_folding='unhide'}
film_rank_sql <- dbGetQuery(con,
"select f.film_id,f.title,f.rental_rate,count(*) count,f.rental_rate * count(*) rental_amt
   from rental r join inventory i on r.inventory_id = i.inventory_id 
        join film f on i.film_id = f.film_id
 group by f.film_id,f.title,f.rental_rate
 order by count(*) desc")
  
sp_print_df(film_rank_sql)
```

`r sp_color_markdown_text("The most frequently rented movie, 34 times, is 'Bucket Brotherhood' followed by Rocketeer Mother, 33 times.",'blue')`

#### Replicate the output above using dplyr syntax.

```{r include=INCLUDE_OUTPUT}
# sp_tbl_descr('store')
# sp_tbl_pk_fk('table_name')
# sp_print_df(table_rows_sql)

film_rank_dplyr <- as.data.frame("code me")

sp_print_df(film_rank_dplyr)
```

### 11 What is the rental distribution/DVD for the top two rented films?

From the previous exercise we know that the top two films are `Bucket Brotherhood` and `Rocketeer Mother`.  

To answer this question we look at the `rental`, `inventory`, and `film` tables again.  

Instead of looking at the film level, we need to drill down to the individual dvd's for each film to answer this question.


```{r, code_folding='unhide'}
film_rank2_sql <- dbGetQuery(con,
"select i.store_id,i.film_id,f.title,i.inventory_id,count(*) 
   from rental r join inventory i on r.inventory_id = i.inventory_id 
        join film f on i.film_id = f.film_id
  where i.film_id in (103,738)
group by i.store_id,i.film_id,f.title,i.inventory_id")

sp_print_df(film_rank2_sql)
```

`r sp_color_markdown_text("The 'Bucket Brotherhood' and 'Rocketeer Mother' DVD's are equally distributed between the two stores, 4 dvd's each per film.  The 'Bucket Brotherhood' was rented 17 times from both stores.  The 'Rocketeer Mother' was rented 15 times from store 1 and 18 times from store 2.",'blue')`

#### Replicate the output above using dplyr syntax.

```{r include=INCLUDE_OUTPUT}
# sp_tbl_descr('store')
# sp_tbl_pk_fk('table_name')
# sp_print_df(table_rows_sql)

film_rank2_dplyr <- as.data.frame("code me")

sp_print_df(film_rank2_dplyr)
```


### 12.  List staffing information for store 1 associated with the `Bucket Brother` rentals? 

To answer this question we look at the `rental`, `inventory`, `film`, `staff`, `address`, `city`, and `country` tables.  

```{r}
film_103_details_sql <- dbGetQuery(con,
"select i.store_id,i.film_id,f.title,i.inventory_id inv_id,i.store_id inv_store_id
       ,r.rental_date::date rented,r.return_date::date returned

   from rental r join inventory i on r.inventory_id = i.inventory_id 
        join film f on i.film_id = f.film_id
        join staff s on r.staff_id = s.staff_id
        join address a on s.address_id = a.address_id
        join city c on a.city_id = c.city_id
        join country ctry on c.country_id = ctry.country_id
  where i.film_id in (103)
    and r.rental_date::date between '2005-05-01'::date and '2005-06-01'::date
order by r.rental_date

sp_print_df(film_103_details_sql)
```

`r sp_color_markdown_text("In a previous exercise we saw that store 1 based in Canada and store 2 based in Austrailia each had one employee, staff_id 1 and 2 respectively.  We see that Mike from store 1, Canada, had transactions in store 1 and store 2 on 5/25/2005.  Similarly Jon from store 2, Australia, had transaction in store 2 and store 1 on 5/31/2005.  Is this phsically possible, or a key in error?"

### 13.  Which film(s) have never been rented

To answer this question we look at the `film`, `inventory` and `rental` tables.

```{r, code_folding='unhide'}
never_rented_dvds_sql <- dbGetQuery(con,
'select i.store_id,f.film_id, f.title,f.description, i.inventory_id
   from film f join inventory i on f.film_id = i.film_id
        left join rental r on i.inventory_id = r.inventory_id 
  where r.inventory_id is null

)

sp_print_df(never_rented_dvds_sql)
```

`r sp_color_markdown_text("There are only two movies that have not been rented, Academy Dinousaur and Sophie's Choice."
,'blue')`

#### Replicate the output above using dplyr syntax.

```{r include=INCLUDE_OUTPUT}

### 14.  How many films are in each film rating?

To answer this question we look at the `film` table to answer this question.

```{r, code_folding='unhide'}
film_ratings_sql <- dbGetQuery(con,
'select f.rating,count(*)
   from film f 
group by f.rating
order by count(*) desc

)

sp_print_df(film_ratings_sql)
```

`r sp_color_markdown_text("There are 5 ratings and all 5 have roughly 200  movies."

### 15.  What are the different film categories?

To answer this question we look at the `category` table to answer this question.

```{r, code_folding='unhide'}
film_categories_sql <- dbGetQuery(con,
'select * from category'
)

sp_print_df(film_categories_sql)
```

`r sp_color_markdown_text("There are 16 different categories","blue")`

#### Replicate the output above using dplyr syntax.

```{r include=INCLUDE_OUTPUT}

# sp_tbl_pk_fk('table_name')
# sp_print_df(table_rows_sql)

film_categories_dplyr <- as.data.frame("code me")

sp_print_df(film_categories_dplyr)
```

### 16. How many DVD's are in each film categeory?

To answer this question we look at the `category` table again.

```{r, code_folding='unhide'}
film_categories2_sql <- dbGetQuery(con,
'select c.name,count(*) count
   from category c join film_category fc on c.category_id = fc.category_id
group by c.name
order by count(*) desc
'
)

sp_print_df(film_categories2_sql)
```

`r sp_color_markdown_text('There are 16 film categories.  The highest category, Sports, has 77 films followed by the International category which has 76 film.  What is an example of an international category film where all films are currently in English?','blue')`

film_categories2_dplyr <- as.data.frame("code me")

sp_print_df(film_categories2_dplyr)

```

### 17.  Which films are listed in multiple categories?

To answer this question we look at the `film`, `film_category` and `category` tables.

```{r, code_folding='unhide'}
multiple_categories_sql <- dbGetQuery(con,
'select f.film_id, f.title,c.name
   from film_category fc join film f on fc.film_id = f.film_id

sp_print_df(multiple_categories_sql)
```

`r sp_color_markdown_text("There is only one film which has two categories, Sophie's Choice.",'blue')`

#### Replicate the output above using dplyr syntax.

### 18.  Which DVD's are in one store's inventory but not the other

In the table below we show the first `r HEAD_N` rows.  

To answer this question we look at the `inventory` and `film` tables.

```{r, code_folding='unhide'}

dvd_in_1_store_sql <- dbGetQuery(

### 19.  Which films are not tracked in inventory?

To answer this question we look at the `film` and `rental` tables.

```{r, code_folding='unhide'}
films_no_inventory_sql <- dbGetQuery(con,
"
select f.film_id,title,rating,rental_rate,replacement_cost

### 20 List film categories in descending accounts receivable.

To answer this question we look at the `rental`, `inventory`, `film`, `film_category` and `category`  tables.


```{r, code_folding='unhide'}

### 23.  Are there duplicate customers?

To answer this question we look at the `customer`, `address`, `city`, and `country` tables.

We assume that if the customer first and last name match in two different rows, then it is a duplicate customer. 

```{r code_folding='unhide' }
customer_dupes_sql <- dbGetQuery(
  con,
  "select cust.customer_id id

### 25. Who are the top 5 customers with the most rentals and associated payments?

This exercise uses the `customer`, `rental`, and `payment` tables.

```{r, code_folding='unhide'}

rentals        |                      |customer rentals

Use the dplyr inner_join verb to find the top 5 customers who have rented the most movies.

```{r, include=INCLUDE_OUTPUT}

sp_print_df(head(customer_top_rentals_dplyr,n=5))
```        

### 26. Combine the top 5 rental customers, (40 or more rentals), and zero rental customers

To answer this question we look at the `customer`, `rental`, and `payments` tables again.

```{r, code_folding='unhide'}
customer_rental_high_low_sql <- dbGetQuery(

### 27.  Who are the top-n1 and bottom-n2 customers?

The issue with the two previous reports is that the top end is hardcoded, rentals  > 40.  Over time, the current customers will always be in the top section and new customers will get added.  Another way of looking at the previous report is to show just the top and bottom 5 customers.  

Parameterize the previous exercise to show the top 5 and bottom 5 customers. 

To answer this question we look at the `customer`, `rental`, and `payments` tables again.

```{r, code_folding='unhide'}
customer_rentals_hi_low_sql <- function(high_n,low_n) {
    customer_rental_high_low_sql <- dbGetQuery(con,
        "select *
           from (     select *
                            ,ROW_NUMBER() OVER(ORDER BY rentals desc) rent_hi_low
                            ,ROW_NUMBER() OVER(ORDER BY rentals ) rent_low_hi
                       FROM (    
                                 select c.customer_id id
                                       ,concat(c.first_name,' ',c.last_name) customer
                                       ,count(*) cust_cnt
                                       ,count(r.rental_id) rentals
                                       ,count(p.payment_id) payments
                                       ,sum(coalesce(p.amount,0)) paid_amt
                                  from customer c 
                                       left outer join rental r on c.customer_id = r.customer_id
                                       left outer join payment p on r.rental_id = p.rental_id
                                 group by c.customer_id
                                        ,c.first_name
                                        ,c.last_name
                            ) as summary
                ) row_nums
           where rent_hi_low <= $1 or rent_low_hi <= $2
          order by rent_hi_low
        "
           ,c(high_n,low_n)
        )
    return (customer_rental_high_low_sql)
}
```

The next code block executes a sql version of such a function.  With top_n = 5 and bot_n = 5, it replicates the hard coded version of the previous exercise. With top_n = 5 and bot_n = 0, it gives a top 5 report.  With top_n = 0 and bot_n = 5, the report returns the bottom 5.  Change the two parameters to see the output from the different combinations.

```{r}
top_n = 5
bot_n = 5
sp_print_df(customer_rentals_hi_low_sql(top_n,bot_n))
```

#### Replicate the function above use dplyr syntax.

### 28.  How much has each store collected?

How are the stores performing?  The SQL code shows the payments made to each store in the business.

```{r, code_folding='unhide'}
store_payments_sql <- dbGetQuery(
  con,
  "select s.store_id,sum(p.amount) amount,count(*) cnt 
                   from payment p 
                        join staff s 
                          on p.staff_id = s.staff_id  
                 group by store_id order by 2 desc
                 ;
                "
)
sp_print_df(store_payments_sql)
```

`r sp_color_markdown_text('Each store collected just over 30,000 in revenue and each store had about 7300 rentals.','blue')`

store_payments_dplyr <- as.data.frame("code me")

sp_print_df(store_payments_dplyr)
```




### 29.  What is the business' distribution of payments?

To answer this question we look at the `rental`, `payment`, `inventory`, and `film` tables to answer this question.

As a sanity check, we first check the number of rentals and amount payments.


```{r}
rentals_payments_sql <- dbGetQuery(con,
"select 'rentals' rec_type, count(*) cnt_amt from rental
 union

#### Replicate the output above using dplyr syntax.

This table describes the columns in the code block answer that follows.  There are payment records where the charged amount, rental rate, is less than the amount paid.  These payments are split into two pieces, rate_lt_paid and rate_lt_over_paid.  The rate_lt_paid is rental rate amount.  The rate_lt_over_paid is the paid amount - rental rate, the over paid amount.

### 30.  Which customers have the highest open amounts?

From the previous exercise, we know that there are 1477 missing payment records or not fully paid payment records.  List the top 5 customers from each category base on balance due amounts.

To answer this question we look at the `rental`, `payment`, `inventory`, `film` and `customer` tables to answer this question.

### 31. What is the business cash flow?

In the previous exercise we saw that about 50% of the rentals collected the correct amount and 40% of the rentals over collected.  The last 10% were never collected.

### 32.  Customer information

Create a function that takes a customer id and returns

The following code block executes the customer function. Change the `cust_id` value to see differnt customers.

```{r}
cust_id <- 600
sp_print_df( customer_details_fn_sql(cust_id))
