# Securing and using your dbms log-in credentials {#chapter_dbms-login-credentials}

> This chapter demonstrates how to:

>  * Keep necessary credentials secret or at least invisible
>  * Interact with PostgreSQL using your stored dbms credentials

Connecting to a dbms can be very frustrating at first.  In many organizations, simply **getting** access credentials takes time and may involve jumping through multiple hoops.  In addition, a dbms is terse or deliberately inscrutable when your credetials are incorrect.  That's a security strategy, not a limitation of your understanding or of your software.  When R can't log you on to a dbms, you usually will have no information as to what went wrong.

There are many different strategies for managing credentials.  See [Securing Credentials](https://db.rstudio.com/best-practices/managing-credentials/) in RStudio's *Databases using R* documentation for some alternatives to the method we adopt in this book.  We provide more details about [PostgreSQL Authentication](#chapter_appendix-postresql-authentication) in our sandbox environment in an appendix.

The following packages are used in this chapter:
```{r setup, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(DBI)
library(RPostgres)
require(knitr)
library(sqlpetr)
library(connections)
sleep_default <- 3
theme_set(theme_light())
```
## Set up the adventureworks Docker container

### Verify that Docker is running

Check that Docker is up and running:

```{r}
sp_check_that_docker_is_up()
```
### Start the Docker container:

Start the adventureworks Docker container:
```{r check on adventureworks}
sp_docker_start("adventureworks")
```

## Storing your dbms credentials

In previous chapters the connection string for connecting to the dbms has used default credentials specified in plain text as follows:

  `user= 'postgres', password = 'postgres'`

When we call `sp_get_postgres_connection` below we'll use environment variables that R obtains from reading the *.Renviron* file when R starts up.  This approach has two benefits: that file is not uploaded to GitHub and R looks for it in your default directory every time it loads.  To see whether you have already created that file, use the R Studio Files tab to look at your **home directory**:

![](screenshots/locate-renviron-file.png)

That file should contain lines that **look like** the example below. Although in this example it contains the PostgreSQL <b>default values</b> for the username and password, they are obviously not secret.  But this approach demonstrates where you should put secrets that R needs while not risking accidental uploaded to GitHub or some other public location..

Open your `.Renviron` file with this command:

>
> `file.edit("~/.Renviron")`
>

Or you can execute [define_postgresql_params.R](define_postgresql_params.R) to create the file or you could copy / paste the following into your **.Renviron** file:
```
DEFAULT_POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres
DEFAULT_POSTGRES_USER_NAME=postgres
```
Once that file is created, restart R, and after that R reads it every time it comes up. 

### Connect with Postgres using the Sys.getenv function

Connect to the postgrSQL using the `sp_get_postgres_connection` function:
```{r}
Sys.sleep(sleep_default)
# con <- connection_open(  # use in an interactive session
con <- dbConnect(          # use in other settings
  RPostgres::Postgres(),
  # without the previous and next lines, some functions fail with bigint data 
  #   so change int64 to integer
  bigint = "integer",  
  user = Sys.getenv("DEFAULT_POSTGRES_USER_NAME"),
  password = Sys.getenv("DEFAULT_POSTGRES_PASSWORD"),
  host = "localhost",
  port = 5432,
  dbname = "adventureworks")
```
Once the connection object has been created, you can list all of the tables in one of the schemas:
```{r}
dbExecute(con, "set search_path to humanresources, public;") # watch for duplicates!
dbListTables(con)
```
## Disconnect from the database and stop Docker

```{r}
dbDisconnect(con)
# or if using the connections package, use:
# connection_close(con)

sp_docker_stop("adventureworks")
```
