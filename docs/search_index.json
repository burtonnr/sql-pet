How well do you understand the data resource (in the DBMS)? Use all available documentation and understand its limits Use your own tools and skills to examine the data resource What is missing from the database: (columns, records, cells) Why is the data missing? How well do you understand the question you seek to answer? How general or specific is your question? How aligned is it with the purpose for which the database was designed and is being operated? How different are your assumptions and concerns from those of the people who enter and use the data on a day to day basis? 4.3 Ask yourself, what are you aiming for? Differences between production and data warehouse environments. Learning to keep your DBAs happy: You are your own DBA in this simulation, so you can wreak havoc and learn from it, but you can learn to be DBA-friendly here. In the end it’s the subject-matter experts that understand your data, but you have to work with your DBAs first. 4.3.1 Problems that are addressed Database exploration Wisdom from Sophie 4.3.2 Learning Objectives After working through the code in this book, you can expect to be able to: R, SQL and PostgreSQL Run queries against PostgreSQL in an environment that simulates what is found in a corporate setting. Understand techniques and some of the trade-offs between: queries aimed at exploration or informal investigation using dplyr (Wickham 2018); and queries that should be written in SQL, because performance is important due to the size of the database or the frequency with which a query is to be run. Understand the equivalence between dplyr and SQL queries, and how R translates one into the other. Gain familiarity with techniques that help you explore a database and verify its documentation. Gain familiarity with the standard metadata that a SQL database contains to describe its own contents. Understand some advanced SQL techniques. Gain some understanding of techniques for assessing query structure and performance. Docker related Set up a PostgreSQL database in a Docker environment. Gain familiarity with the various ways of interacting with the Docker and PostgreSQL environments Understand enough about Docker to swap databases, e.g. Sports DB for the DVD rental database used in this tutorial. Or swap the database management system (DBMS), e.g. MySQL for PostgreSQL. 4.3.3 R Packages These R packages are discussed or used in exercises: DBI dbplyr devtools downloader glue gt here knitr RPostgres skimr sqlpetr (installs with: remotes::install_github(&quot;smithjd/sqlpetr&quot;, force = TRUE, quiet = TRUE, build = TRUE, build_opts = &quot;&quot;)) tidyverse In addition, these are used to render the book: * bookdown * DiagrammeR 4.4 Imagining a DVD rental business Years ago, people rented videos on DVD disks and video stores were a big business. To understand the data base that we use in this book, try to imagine managing a video rental store like Movie Madness in Portland, Oregon. What data would be needed and what questions would you have to answer about the business? This tutorial uses the PostgreSQL version of “dvd rental” database which represents the transaction database for running a movie (e.g., dvd) rental business. The database can be downloaded here. Here’s a glimpse of it’s structure, which we explore using several different methods: Entity Relationship diagram for the dvdrental database A data analyst uses the database abstraction and the practical business questions to make better decisions and solve problems. 4.5 Use cases Imagine that you have one of following several roles at our fictional company DVDs R Us and you have a following need to be met: As a data scientist, I want to know the distribution of number of rentals per month per customer, so that the Marketing department can create incentives for customers in 3 segments: Frequent Renters, Average Renters, Infrequent Renters. As the Director of Sales, I want to see the total number of rentals per month for the past 6 months and I want to know how fast our customer base is growing/shrinking per month for the past 6 months. As the Director of Marketing, I want to know which categories of DVDs are the least popular, so that I can create a campaign to draw attention to rarely used inventory. As a shipping clerk, I want to add rental information when I fulfill a shipment order. As the Director of Analytics, I want to test as much of the production R code in my shop as possible against a new release of the DBMS that the IT department is implementing next month. etc. References "]
