This tutorial assumes that (1) you have PostgreSQL installed on your computer, and (2) that you have configured your system to run psql at the command line. Installation of PostgreSQL and configuration of psql are outside the scope of this book. B.1.1 Download the dvdrental database Download the dvdrental database from here. Locate the zip file in your downloads folder and move the zip file to the desired folder location on your machine. Navigate to the location where the dvdrental.zip file is stored. Unzip the file to retrieve the dvdrental.tar file. Note to Mac users: The default Mac OS unpacking feature may not show the dvdrental.tar file when unzipping the file. It may be necessary to use another program to unzip the file and retain the dvdrental.tar file. B.1.2 Restore the dvdrental database at the command line Launch the psql tool Enter account information to log into the PostgreSQL database server, if prompted Enter the following command to create a new database CREATE DATABASE dvdrental; Open a new terminal window (not in psql) and navigate to the folder where the dvdrental.tar file is locate. Use the cd command in the terminal, followed by the file path to change directories to the location of dvdrental.tar. For example: cd /Users/username/Documents/dvdrental. Enter the following command prompt: pg_restore -d dvdrental -U user_name dvdrental.tar Alternatively, if you did not unzip the file to .tar format, you can use psql to restore the database from the .sql file. Enter the following command at the psql command line: psql -U postgres -d newdvdrental -f restore.sql. Note that this method is not recommended for the dvdrental database because it was backed up with the intent to be restored only from .tar format. Restoring via this method does work, but errors are introduced that do not occur when restoring the .tar file. B.1.3 Restore the dvdrental database using pgAdmin Another option to restore the dvdrental database locally on your machine is with the pgAdmin graphical user interface. However, we highly recommend using the command line methods detailed above. Installation and configuration of pgAdmin is outside the scope of this book.
